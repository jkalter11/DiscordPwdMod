This Version of DiscordPwd Requires the following python prerequisites:
pygame
discord

the pwdInternal.txt contains your Discord Password, not your account but one you can set. THIS IS INTERNAL. This data is not kept on a server, password checks happen on client side.
Passwords are also hashed, and maybe salted but that's depending on whether I can be assed to program salts.
